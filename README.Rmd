# keys

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of keys is to add hotkeys to shiny applications using [`mousetrap.js`](https://github.com/ccampbell/mousetrap).

## Installation

You can the development version from GitHub with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("r4fun/keys")
```

## Usage

Simply provide a `keysInput` to the UI:

```r
library(shiny)
library(keys)

hotkeys <- c(
  "1", 
  "command+shift+k", 
  "up up down down left right left right b a enter"
)

ui <- fluidPage(
  keysInput("keys", hotkeys)
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  observeEvent(input$keys, {
    print(input$keys)
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

For more information about what types of hotkeys you can use, please take a look at the mousetrap github [repository](https://github.com/ccampbell/mousetrap).
